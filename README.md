Intiface Central is a frontend application for the [Buttplug Sex Toy Control Library](https://buttplug.io), for Desktop (Win/macOS/Linux) and Mobile (Android/iOS).

For users, it provides simple, friendly capabilites for managing, connecting, customizing devices.

For developers, it allows their application to connect to and control sex toys, without having to worry about constantly updating the underlying libraries or dealing with bugs and crashes in a difficult-to-debug cross langauge environment.

## Ok But Where's the Source Code?

Since the codebase is in Flutter and shared between Desktop/Mobile, we're in a bit of a difficult position in that pre-releasing mobile code has, in the past, resulted in versions of applications appearing on app stores before the actual application was released.

Rest assured that the full codebase will be open sourced as soon as we get into all of the relevant app stores (apps are in review now), but for now, this repo will be used to house issues and distribute alpha releases.

## How to Get Support

Support is currently available via:

- Posting issues to this github repo, assuming you have a github account
- On [our discord server](https://discord.buttplug.io)
- On our Discourse forums, as soon as they're up.
